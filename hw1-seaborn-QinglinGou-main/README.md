Learning goals:

* Creating multiple subplots with matplotlib
* Converting messy data into a tidy dataframe
* Creating Seaborn plots, including customization with the matplotlib API

# Assignment
Whole code:
```
make whole code
```

## 1. Use Seaborn to recreate Figure 1.1 in the book, including the models, with all 3 subplots in the same figure.
```
make Q1
```

## 2. Use Seaborn with the Smarket dataset (in the rdata repo) to recreate Figure 1.2 in the book from the original (messy) dataframe.
```
make Q2
```

## 3. Put a dataframe with the Smarket dataset into tidy form. Use `.head()` to print the first few lines the result.
```
make Q3
```

## 4. Recreate Figure 1.2 with Seaborn using the tidy form of the Smarket dataset.
```
make Q4
```
